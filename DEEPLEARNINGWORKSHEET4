11)What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a machine learning technique. It teaches a computer to filter inputs through layers to learn how to predict and classify information. 
Observations can be in the form of images, text, or sound. The inspiration for deep learning is the way that the human brain filters information
12)What is reinforcement learning?
Reinforcement Learning is defined as a Machine Learning method that is concerned with how software agents should take actions in an environment. 
Reinforcement Learning is a part of the deep learning method that helps you to maximize some portion of the cumulative reward.

13)What Are the Differences Between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset, an application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that offers the ability to the system to learn and 
improve from experience without being programmed to that level. Machine Learning uses data to train and find accurate results.
 Machine learning focuses on the development of a computer program that accesses the data and uses it to learn from themselves.

Deep Learning: Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning where the artificial neural network, the recurrent neural network comes in relation. 
The algorithms are created exactly just like machine learning but it consists of many more levels of algorithms.
 All these networks of the algorithm are together called as the artificial neural network. In much simpler terms,
 it replicates just like the human brain as all the neural networks are connected in the brain, 
 exactly is the concept of deep learning. It solves all the complex problems with the help of algorithms and its process.
 
 14) What is a perceptron?
 A perceptron is a simple model of a biological neuron in an artificial neural network. 
 Perceptron is also the name of an early algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers.

The perceptron algorithm was designed to classify visual inputs, categorizing subjects into one of two types and separating groups with a line. 
Classification is an important part of machine learning and image processing.

15)Whatâ€™s the difference between AI and ML?

we can differentiate both AI and ML as: AI is a bigger concept to create intelligent machines that can simulate human thinking capability and behavior, whereas, 
machine learning is an application or subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data without being programmed explicitly.
