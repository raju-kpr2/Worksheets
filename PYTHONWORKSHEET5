11) List any two major differences between lists and sets in python.
List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.
12) write a python program to square the elements of a list by using list comprehension
x = (x **2 for x in range(20))
print(x)
x = list(x)
print(x)

def Remove(duplicate): 
    final_list = [] 
    for num in duplicate: 
        if num not in final_list: 
            final_list.append(num) 
    return final_list 
      
# Driver Code 
duplicate = [2, 4, 10, 20, 5, 2, 20, 4] 
print(Remove(duplicate)) 
[2, 4, 10, 20, 5]
14. Take two sets of numbers and try implementing the set operations - intersection, union, difference and
symmetric_difference between them.
A = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}
B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
# union 
print("Union :", A | B) 
('Union :', set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]))
  
# intersection 
print("Intersection :", A & B) 
 ('Intersection :', set([2, 4]))

# difference 
print("Difference :", A - B) 
 ('Difference :', set([8, 0, 6]))

# symmetric difference 
print("Symmetric difference :", A ^ B) 
('Symmetric difference :', set([0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8]))


15. Write a python program to add the elements of a set.

set1 = set() 
for i in range(1, 6): 
    set1.add(i) 
print("\nSet after Addition of elements from 1-5: ") 
print(set1)
