11)Differentiate between a list, tuple, set and dictionary

Lists

	List is a collection which is ordered.
	Lists are mutable (changeable) .
	Allows duplicate members
	Brackets used to represent: []
	
Tuples

	Collection of items which is ordered.
	Tuples are immutable (unchangeable) .
	Brackets used to represent: ()
	Only difference between tuples and lists are that lists can be changed.
	Tuples are faster than lists as they are immutable.

Sets

	Collection of Unordered and Unindexed items.
	Sets are mutable (changeable).
	Does not take duplicate Values.
	Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.
	Brackets used to represent: { }.
	
Dictionaries

	Dictionaries are Key:Value Pair 
	It is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.
	dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and they have keys and values.
	Brackets used to represent: {}.
	
12) Are strings mutable in python? Suppose you have a string “I+Love+Python”, write a small code to replace ‘+’
with space in python	

mytext="I+Love+Python"
mytext=mytext.replace("+"," ")
print(mytext)

13) What does the function ord() do in python? Explain with example. Also, write down the function for getting
the datatype of a variable in python.

 The function ord()  returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character.
 
 def getDataType(a):
    return type(a)
    
14. Write a python program to solve a quadratic equation of the form 𝑎𝑥
2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0. Where a, b and c are to
be taken by user input. Handle the erroneous input, such as ‘a’ should not be equal to 0.


import cmath
b,c=0,0
def IsNotZero(a):
    if a>0 :
        b=int(input("Enter b : "))
        c=int(input("Enter c : "))
         
        d=(b**2)-(4*a*c) #calculate the discriminant
        # find two solutions
        sol1 = (-b-cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)
        sol2 = (-b+cmath.sqrt(d))/(2*a)

        print('The solution are {0} and {1}'.format(sol1,sol2))
    else :
        print("Enter the real number a!=0")
        return 
a = int(input('Enter a: '))
c=IsNotZero(a)
