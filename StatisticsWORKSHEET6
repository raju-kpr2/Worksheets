10)What Is Bayes' Theorem?
Bayes' Theorem is a simple mathematical formula used for calculating conditional probabilities.
It is the probability of an event happening, given that it has some relationship to one or more other events.
Marginal Probability
Joint Probability
Conditional Probability
11)What is z-score?
 z-score can be placed on a normal distribution curve. Z-scores range from -3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far left of the normal distribution curve) 
 up to +3 standard deviations (which would fall to the far right of the normal distribution curve). 
 A positive z-score indicates the raw score is higher than the mean average.
 A negative z-score reveals the raw score is below the mean average.
 
12)What is t-test? 
A t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine 
whether a process or treatment actually has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another.

13)What is a percentile? 
A  percentile  is a comparison score between a particular score and the scores of the rest of a group. It shows the percentage of scores that a particular score surpassed. 
For example, if you score 75 points on a test, and are ranked in the 85 th  percentile, it means that the score 75 is higher than 85% of the scores.

14)What is ANOVA? 
An ANOVA test is a way to find out if survey or experiment results are significant.
In other words, they help you to figure out if you need to reject the null hypothesis or accept the alternate hypothesis.

15)How can ANOVA help?
The one-way ANOVA can help you know whether or not there are significant differences between the means of your independent variables (such as the first example: age, sex, income). 
When you understand how each independent variable’s mean is different from the others.
