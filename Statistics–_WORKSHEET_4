10) What do you understand by the term Normal Distribution?

The normal distribution is a probability function that describes how the values of a variable are distributed.
 It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations cluster around the central peak and 
 the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions

11) How do you handle missing data? What imputation techniques do you recommend?

Therefore, a number of alternative ways of handling the missing data has been developed.
Listwise or case deletion
Pairwise deletion
Mean substitution
Regression imputation
Last observation carried forward
Maximum likelihood
Expectation-Maximization
Multiple imputation.


12) What is A/B testing

A/B testing (also known as split testing) is a process of showing two variants of the same web page to different 
segments of website visitors at the same time and comparing which variant drives more conversions

13) Is mean imputation of missing data acceptable practice?

imputation is the process of replacing missing data with substituted values

14) 
Linear regression attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
 One variable is considered to be an explanatory variable, and the other is considered to be a dependent variable. For example, 
a modeler might want to relate the weights of individuals to their heights using a linear regression model.

Statistics may be divided into two main branches:
(1) Descriptive Statistics (2) Inferential Statistics
